A new Flutter project to learn Bloc Paterrn and NewsAPI.org.

## Goal of project:

The idea of this Project was to learn how to use bloc pattern and consume API of a news API provider.
Bloc Pattern is one of the main ways to professionally deal with state controller in Flutter. 
Mixing it with a NewsAPI provider make it the perfect project to emulate the behaviour of realtime applications.
