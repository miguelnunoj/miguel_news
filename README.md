A new Flutter project to learn Bloc Paterrn and NewsAPI.org.

## Goal of project:

The idea of this Project was to learn how to use bloc pattern and consume API of a news API provider.
Bloc Pattern is one of the main ways to professionally deal with state controller in Flutter. 
Mixing it with a NewsAPI provider make it the perfect project to emulate the behaviour of realtime applications.
The goal wasnt really the visual desgin of the App rather it was more the system design.
